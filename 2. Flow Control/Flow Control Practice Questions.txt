Practice Questions
1. What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
A: True & False (= False)

2. What are the three Boolean operators?
A: and, or & not

3. Write out the truth tables of each Boolean operator (that is, every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what they evaluate to).
A:
and                   or                   not
True  True  True      True  True  True     True   False
True  False False     True  False True     False  True
False True  False     False True  True
False False False     False False False

4. What do the following expressions evaluate to?

(5 > 4) and (3 == 5): False
not (5 > 4): Faalse
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5): True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5)): False
(True and True) and (True == False): False
(not False) or (not True): True

5. What are the six comparison operators?
A:  < = Less than
    > = Greater than
    == = Equal to
    != = Not equal to
    <= = Less than or equal to
    >= = Greater than or equal to
    
6. What is the difference between the equal to operator and the assignment operator?
A:   The equal to operator (==) is used to perform a comparison to left and right sides of an expression.
     The assignment operator (=) is used to assign the value on the right side of the expression to the variable on the left side of the operator 

7. Explain what a condition is and where you would use one.
A: Condition is where code is only meant to be run if certain conditions are met

8. Identify the three blocks in this code:


spam = 0 **BLOCK 1**
if spam == 10:**BLOCK 1**
    print('eggs')**BLOCK 2**
    if spam > 5:**BLOCK 2**
        print('bacon')**BLOCK 3**
    else:**BLOCK 2**
        print('ham') **BLOCK 3**
    print('spam')**BLOCK 2**
print('spam')**BLOCK 1**

9. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
A:

if spam == 1:
    print('Hello')
elif spam == 2:
    print('Howdy')
else:
    print('Greetings!')
 

10. What can you press if your program is stuck in an infinite loop?
A: CTRL+C

11. What is the difference between break and continue?
A: Break will exit out of the loop whereas Continue will progress with the next iteration of the loop.

12. What is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1) in a for loop?
A: Functionally nothing, however the arguments that are passed could change the way that the range function behaves.
    range(stop), range([start], stop), range([start], stop,[increment])

13. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
A:

for x in range(1, 11):
    print(x)
--------------------------
x = 1
while x <= 10:
  print(x)
  x += 1

14. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?
A:

import spam

spam.bacon()

Extra credit: Look up the round() and abs() functions on the Internet, and find out what they do. Experiment with them in the interactive shell.
round() is used to round numbers to a specific number of decimal places.
abs() is used to find the absolute value
